- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I,m Steve
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning arduino coding and i would like a simple code that will detect a shaft rotation and direction.
I do not need to know its position or speed just to know it is rotating and which direction .
I am happy to use hall effect , encoder , reed switch etc....
